The example demonstration QM infrastructure mode data transfer using host and 
monolthic descriptors on single core or a single process.

Both polling and accumulation modes are showcased. 

This example works on both the c66x (big and little endian) as well as the A15
(little endian).

On the A15, the example should be started once from a Linux shell.  
On A15, the example requires rmServer.out to be started first using the 
global resource list (global-resource-list.dtb) and policy 
(policy_dsp_arm.dtb) for your device.
