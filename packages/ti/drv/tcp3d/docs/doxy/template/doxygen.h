 * Texas Instruments Incorporated and its subsidiaries (TI) reserve the right
 * to make corrections, modifications, enhancements, improvements, and other
 * changes to its products and services at any time and to discontinue any
 * product or service without notice. Customers should obtain the latest
 * relevant information before placing orders and should verify that such
 * information is current and complete. All products are sold subject to TI’s
 * terms and conditions of sale supplied at the time of order acknowledgment.
 *
 * TI warrants performance of its hardware products to the specifications
 * applicable at the time of sale in accordance with TI’s standard warranty.
 * Testing and other quality control techniques are used to the extent TI
 * deems necessary to support this warranty. Except where mandated by
 * government requirements, testing of all parameters of each product is not
 * necessarily performed.
 *
 * TI assumes no liability for applications assistance or customer product
 * design. Customers are responsible for their products and applications
 * using TI components. To minimize the risks associated with customer
 * products and applications, customers should provide adequate design and
 * operating safeguards.
 *
 * TI does not warrant or represent that any license, either express or
 * implied, is granted under any TI patent right, copyright, mask work right,
 * or other TI intellectual property right relating to any combination,
 * machine, or process in which TI products or services are used. Information
 * published by TI regarding third-party products or services does not
 * constitute a license from TI to use such products or services or a warranty
 * or endorsement thereof. Use of such information may require a license from a
 * third party under the patents or other intellectual property of the third
 * party, or a license from TI under the patents or other intellectual property
 * of TI.
 *
 * Reproduction of information in TI data books or data sheets is permissible
 * only if reproduction is without alteration and is accompanied by all
 * associated warranties, conditions, limitations, and notices. Reproduction
 * of this information with alteration is an unfair and deceptive business
 * practice. TI is not responsible or liable for such altered documentation.
 *
 * Resale of TI products or services with statements different from or beyond
 * the parameters stated by TI for that product or service voids all express
 * and any implied warranties for the associated TI product or service and is
 * an unfair and deceptive business practice. TI is not responsible or liable
 * for any such statements.
