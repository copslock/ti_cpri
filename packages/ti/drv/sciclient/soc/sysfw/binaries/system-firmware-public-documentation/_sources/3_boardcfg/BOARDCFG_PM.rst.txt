Power Management Configuration in System Firmware
=================================================

The power management portion of system firmware has options that can be
configured independently of the main Board Configuration. In addition,
initialization of the power management portion of the system firmware
can be deferred until this PM board configuration is sent to allow tuning of
the system boot time.

.. warning::

   The TISCI_MSG_BOARD_CONFIG_PM message MUST be sent in order to initialize
   the power management capabilities of system firmware. Until it is received
   no power management functionality is available. **IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
   THAT THIS MESSAGE BE SENT IMMEDIATELY AFTER TISCI_MSG_BOARD_CONFIG TO
   ENSURE RM AND SECURITY HAVE ALL RESOURCES CONFIGURED AS NEEDED.**

   The system remains in ROM configured PLL and clock configuration till this
   message is invoked. On invoking this call, standard OFC associated with the
   SoC is configured. This implies that many of three PLLs and clock tree will
   get reconfigured. IP level subdividers may need reconfiguration to continue
   operation at desired frequency after this switch over takes place. Though
   the ROM configured PLL is expected to be safe, it is usually suboptimal for
   complete operation of the SoC.

   It is strongly recommended for proper care to be taken for key peripherals
   that may be operational and communicating external to SoC. For example,
   depending on the SoC and product, pinmux can be used to move the IP's pins
   into isolation to prevent glitch events from being exported from the IP at
   the point of reconfiguration of PLLs system wide to the official OFC
   configuration.

A standalone board configuration message contains the power management data
within a flat-typed array.  The power management configuration is provided
separately to reduce DMSC boot time.  The power management board cfg message is
sent any time after the boot notification message is sent and has no dependence
upon receipt of the standard board configuration message.

TISCI API for PM Board Config
-----------------------------

The following are the parameters required in the TI-SCI message to pass power management
board configuration data to DMSC after DMSC sends boot notification complete.
The PM board configuration message is not dependent on receipt of the
standard board configuration message.

boardcfg_pm structure
---------------------

This is a fixed size c-structure which both defines the format of the
configuration as well as reserves DMSC memory to store the configuration.
However, the boardcfg_pm data structure is **currently empty**.

.. warning::

   Although currently empty, in order to properly initialize the PM subsystem
   this message must still be sent with the address and size parameters all
   configured to 0.


.. note::

   Although currently empty, PM Board configuration requires to be signed and
   encrypted on HS devices to ensure authenticity and protect secrets. Please
   refer to :doc:`../6_topic_user_guides/hs_boardcfg_signing` on how to sign and
   encrypt board configuration on HS devices.
