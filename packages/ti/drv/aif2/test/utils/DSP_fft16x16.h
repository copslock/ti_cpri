/**
 *      The following code performs a mixed radix FFT for "npoints" which 
 *      is either a multiple of 4 or 2. It uses logN4 - 1 stages of radix4
 *      transform and performs either a radix2 or radix4 transform on the 
 *      last stage depending on "npoints". If "npoints" is a multiple of 4
 *      then this last stage is also a radix4 transform, otherwise it is a
 *      radix2 transform.                                                 
 *
 *          @param  ptr_w   =  input twiddle factors    
 *          @param  npoints =  number of points         
 *          @param  ptr_x   =  transformed data reversed
 *          @param  ptr_y   =  linear transformed data  
 *
 * @par Algorithm:
 * DSP_fft16x16_cn.c is the natural C equivalent of the optimized intrinsic C
 * code without restrictions. Note that the intrinsic C code is optimized and
 * restrictions may apply.  
 * 
 * @par Assumptions:
 *     In-place computation is not allowed. <BR>                             
 *     Size of FFT, nx, must be power of 2 and 16<=nx<=65536. <BR>                                 
 *     The arrays for the complex input data x[], complex output data y[]
 *        and twiddle factor w[] must be double word aligned. <BR>
 *     The input and output data are complex, with the real/imaginary 
 *        components stored in adjacent locations in the array.  The real
 *        components are stored at even array indices, and the imaginary 
 *        components are stored at odd array indices. <BR>                    
 *
 * @par Implementation Notes:
 * @b Endian Support: The code supports both big and little endian modes. <BR> 
 * @b Interruptibility: The code is interruptible. <BR>
 *
