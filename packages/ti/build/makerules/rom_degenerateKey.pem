In Keystone 3 ROM, the SBL should always be signed with a given openssl
key (Secure and GP devices, Secure will have encryption and
authentication, GP device would only have authentication). The key used
for authentication can be random or specific. If a random key is
generated and SBL is signed with this,the ROM will copy the SBL image for
authentication using memcopy. With this key ,ROM will be directed to use
DMA to load the SBL for authentication which saves boot time.
